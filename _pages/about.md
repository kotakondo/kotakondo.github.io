I am a PhD student at the [Aerospace Controls Lab](https://acl.mit.edu/) at MIT, working under [Professor Jonathan How](https://www.mit.edu/people/jhow/).
My research is centered around developing scalable, fast, and safe trajectory planning methods for UAVs in multi-agent settings, particularly in unknown environments.

Navigating unknown environments even with a single agent presents significant challenges. 
In a multi-agent system, uncertainty adds another layer of complexity. 
My past work has involved fully decentralized asynchronous multi-agent trajectory planners, and I have had the opportunity to demonstrate these planners in multi-agent flights. 
The experience of watching our algorithms come to life in real-world is always exhilarating.

Looking ahead, traditional optimization-based methods, while effective, often suffer from slow computation times, leading to delayed replanning and potential collisions in dynamic settings. 
To address this challenge, our team is exploring an imitation learning-based approach aimed at significantly accelerating trajectory generation onboard.
